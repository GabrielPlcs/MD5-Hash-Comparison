MD5 Hash Comparison
This Bash script allows you to verify the integrity of important files by comparing their MD5 hash values. If the hash values match, the files are considered identical.

Usage
Ensure you have Bash installed on your system.
Download the comparing-hashes.sh file.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
Execute the script with the actual filenames you want to compare:
./comparing-hashes.sh file1 file2
Replace file1 and file2 with the real names of the files.
Example
Suppose you have two files: original-document.txt and copy-of-document.txt. To check if they are identical, run:

./comparing-hashes.sh original-document.txt copy-of-document.txt

Result
If the MD5 hash values match, you’ll see the message:
Hashes match!

If the MD5 hash values do not match, you’ll see the message:
Hashes do not match.

Notes
Make sure the files are in the same directory as the script.
This script uses the md5sum command to calculate MD5 hash values.
